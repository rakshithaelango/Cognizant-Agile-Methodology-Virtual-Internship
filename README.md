# Task 1 - Waterfall vs Agile

* Mainly,This Task-1 is designed TO LEARN, WORK ON, and PRESENT INFORMATION about Agile / Waterfall Model.
  
   * Waterfall vs Agile
   * Comparative Analysis Of Two Methodologies (Waterfall vs Agile)

# Task 2 - User Stories

* TASK BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The concept of Interplanetary Internet has been discussed since the mid-80s. As humans prepare to travel to Mars and more distant places, the need for an Interplanetary Internet becomes apparent. The traditional internet and Interplanetary Internet have a lot in common, however there are challenges that are unique to interplanetary communications, including significant latency, small bandwidth and partially lost transmissions.
need to think through the details of how video conference applications that we use daily will be changed for the communication with other planets.

* THE TASK IS: Everybody is excited about developing a video-conferencing app for interplanetary communication. The executive team has decided to go with Agile Methodology. Now it is important to think through customer needs for video conferencing features and functionalities and how they will be impacted by long distances. User stories are defined and refined throughout the project. Your task is to take an initial stab at defining the user stories.
A user story is a small self-contained plain-language explanation of a feature or functionality written from a user's point of view and designed to accomplish a specific goal within the product.

  * This task is to identify 3 - 5 user stories for the new Interplanetary Video-Conferencing application.
  * By using: As a <who>, I want <what> so that <why>.
  * Utilizing the task at hand, Aim to generate user stories.
 
# Task 3 - Role Assignments and Ceremonies

  * TASK BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Getting ready to begin building the initial version of an interplanetary video conferencing app. There are several Agile methodology process frameworks and as a team have decided to use one of the most popular process frameworks: Scrum.

  * THE TASK IS: Preparation for the project need to explain to the rest of the team role assignments and ceremonies in Scrum.
    
  * ROLE ASSIGNMENTS: Describe what the responsibilities are for each role.
    
      * Product Owner
      * Scrum Master
      * Development Team

    * Sprint Planning
    * Daily stand-up
    * Sprint Review
    * Sprint Retrospective 

# TASK 4 - Agile Tools and Concepts

  * TASK BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Begin building the initial version of the interplanetary video-conferencing app. It is time to take a close look at software tools that we can use to manage our Agile Project.

# Task 5 - Agile Curve Balls

  * TASK BACKGROUND INFORMATION: While training on Earth, astronauts spend most of their time running through hypothetical scenarios of how things might go wrong. We need to do the same. what is broken in the development process and suggest a remedy.

  * Scenario 1: The team has a scheduled daily stand-up at 9 am in the morning. The meetings usually take over an hour. A lot of time is spent discussing a tricky dependency between several tasks that requires extensive conversation.

 * Scenario 2: In the beginning of the sprint the tasks were picked up by the development team. However, by the middle of the sprint, development team starts to look to Scrum Master to assign tasks to individual developers.

 * Scenario 3: If a development team member needs to discuss a task with the Product Owner, the developer approaches Scrum Master to help set up a meeting with the Product Owner.

 * Scenario 4: The team is using the latest Agile Application Lifecycle Management tool because it is supposed to be most effective. However, most of the team is having hard time getting used to the tool.

# Task 6 -  Agile Methodology Review and Additional Resources
